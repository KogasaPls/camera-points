# Camera Points ![Plugin Installs](http://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://i.pluginhub.info/shields/installs/plugin/Camera-Points)

This plugin allows you to save and load your camera zoom and a compass direction.
Sadly it is not allowed to load the camera yaw/pitch so only changing the zoom value and optionally setting a cardinal direction is supported by this plugin.

## Settings

Preview on hover allows you to see what the camera zoom would look like after loading it. However this does not apply the compass direction (since there would be no way to get your previous pitch/yaw angle back).
The other option allows you to disable your hotkeys while typing in a chatbox.

## Camera Points list

The compass direction is outlined in brown.
The zoom value is outlined in yellow.
The hotkey is outlined in pink.
The button to load a camera point is outlined in green.
The button to overwrite a camera point is outlined in blue.
The button to remove a camera point is outlined in red.

By clicking the green + you can add a new camera point and then rename it if you like.
It will automatically get your current zoom value. You can change this value by setting a value in the textbox outlined in yellow or load the current zoom value from the game by clicking the button outlined in blue.
To load a camera point you need to either click the button outlined in green or set a hotkey for loading it.
If you want to set a cardinal direction as well as loading the zoom value you set you need to select one from the dropdown list.

Only seting a cardinal direction without changing the zoom value is not supported yet.
